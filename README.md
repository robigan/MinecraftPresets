# What is this?
This is my repository for presets of Minecraft Versions I can spin up in MultiMC 5

I have this setup as a public repo for personal usage, but you can use my presets if u want :)
Different branches have different versions of Minecraft associated with them, and there are precompiled versions available in the Releases section.
